Built a dynamic resume website using React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, developed completely inside the Google Antigravity IDE.

Added structured resume data, animated UI components, and a PDF download option, making it easy to share a clean, consistent, recruiter-ready profile.

This project is part of my AI engineering journey, exploring productivity, rapid prototyping, and the potential of AI-powered coding environments.
