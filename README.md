A dynamic resume website built using React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, developed entirely inside Google Antigravity IDE.

The app uses a structured TypeScript data file for managing resume content, smooth UI animations with Framer Motion, and a built-in PDF export feature for clean, recruiter-friendly downloads.
This project was created to explore AI-assisted development workflows using Antigravity.
